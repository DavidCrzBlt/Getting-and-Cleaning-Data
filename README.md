## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
 This project is about merging related tables. There is a script called "run_analysis.R" that reads all the files inside the folder UCI HAR Dataset.
 
 The script has the "total data" and "d" variables. 
 
 The "total data" variable is a dataframe that contains the test and train tables. Each row is identified with the activity label and the subject that was examined. 
 The "d" variable contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. It is a smaller data set.
 
 The other variables in the script are just to read the documents in the folder and to merge them.
